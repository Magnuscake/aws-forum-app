* Overview
This project was a part of the 2nd Assigment for the Cloud Computing Course at RMIT Melbourne for Semester 1, 2021. The task was a to create a cloud based web application that allows a user to login with their credentials, browse available music artists and subscribe to an artist they like. In the subscription feature in this case is simply subscribing to a song by an artist along with the details associated with song such as year, song title and artist image.

Music and user details and stored in tables in DynamoDB. The images are stored in a bucket in s3. The app was originally hosted on an EC2 instance for the demo, but however, since that is no, I have taken it off. All files are sorted in their corresponding folders, eg: operations related to DynamoDB in its respective folder and so on.
